## **Progress to Date**

x

No unexpected challenges have arisen at this stage in the project, and there are no proposed changes to the scope or timeline.


## **Supervised Learning Approach**

```{python libs, echo = FALSE, paged.print = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
# Importing libraries

import math
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy   # Do I need this?  Could use R for stats instead

from sklearn import ensemble
from sklearn import tree

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

```{python import_df, echo = FALSE, paged.print = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
nhanes = r.nhanes
nhanes_feat = nhanes.drop(['seqn', 'BMI', 'BMI_cat'], axis = 1)
nhanes_labs = nhanes.filter(['BMI_cat'])   # pd .filter() works as a `keep` or dplyr::select()
```

```{python nxk_rkf, echo = FALSE, paged.print = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
rkf = RepeatedKFold(n_splits = 5, n_repeats = 5)   # Reminder:  n = # splits = # folds; k = # repeats
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(nhanes)
```
